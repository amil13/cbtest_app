Celebreak test app
-------------------
## Getting Started
The Test App has the following features:

1) Insert user entry to Cloud Firestore realtime database.
2) Display the users in a scrollable list on the homescreen.
3) Search though the entries.

The code can be improved in many ways and can be written more efficiently.

The search feature requires more development in order to be able to 
select and display a selected entry.

Thank You
